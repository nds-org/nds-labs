# NDSLabs API

This is a draft.

## Overview

The NDSLabs API is a RESTful interface to the NDSLabs system. 

## Key concepts:

* Project: A named configuration that relates an administrative user, represented by a client certificate, to a set of resource allocations (quotas), and resources (namespace, pods/services, volumes, configurations).
* Service definition: A specification of a logical "service" that includes a name, description, storage requirements, configuration options, and relationships to other services. An NDSLabs "service" may be composed of multiple containers.
* Service library: 
* Resource quota:
* Volume:
* Project service:

The NDSLabs API server 

The Kubernetes API server validates and configures data for the api objects which include pods, services, replicationcontrollers, and others. The API Server services REST operations and provides the frontend to the cluster's shared state through which all other components interact.

* Complete API details are documented in Swagger
