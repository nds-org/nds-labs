NDS Labs
========

What's In The Box?
------------------

This is the main repository for the NDS Labs initiative, which is a part of the
broader National Data Service (nationaldataservice.org) effort.

NDSLabs is designed to be an experimental space for developing services and
exploring interoperability between services.

Inside this repo you will find:

 * Dockerfiles for building docker images that can serve as the building blocks
   for data services
 * Servicefiles that manage the lifecycle of services running on a cluster
 * Methods for launching an "NDSLabs" cluster based on CoreOS and Fleet

The individual dockerfiles have been constructed to be as generic as possible,
with information provided to them via environment variables specified at
launch.  (And sane defaults in advance of that.)  In some cases this increases
their startup time, but allows them to be flexible in deployment and
utilization.
